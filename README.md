QGroundControl to Mission Planner conversion script

If you have a parameter dump from QGroundControl, I wrote a small script that will convert it to a Mission Planner compatible file. You can also use Parachute to do your backups/restores/conversions.

Just save this script somewhere as convert_qgc_params and run it as ./convert_qgc_params <qgc params> <output file>:
